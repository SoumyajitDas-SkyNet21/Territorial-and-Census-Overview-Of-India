# Territorial and Census Overview of India: Power BI Data Analysis Project

## 1. Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow using **Power BI**, starting from **web data extraction** to creating **insightful visualizations**. The primary goal was to extract information about the **States and Union Territories of India** from a Wikipedia page, transform it, and then build an **interactive dashboard** to answer key demographic and geographical questions.

### Tools Used:
- **Data Source**: Wikipedia (Web Scraping)
- **Data Transformation & Modeling**: Power BI Desktop (Power Query Editor)
- **Data Visualization & Analysis**: Power BI Desktop

## 2. Data Source

The data for this project was sourced from the following Wikipedia page:  
ðŸ”— [States and Union Territories of India â€“ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India)

Specifically, the table containing the list of States and Union Territories, along with their **population**, **area**, **capital**, and other relevant details, was extracted for analysis.

## 3. Data Extraction & Transformation (Power Query)

### Get Data from Web:
1. In Power BI Desktop, go to **Home > Get Data > Web**.
2. Paste the Wikipedia URL:  
   `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India`
3. In the Navigator window, select Table 5

### Initial Data Inspection:
- Review the loaded data for headers, irrelevant columns, and quality issues.

### Key Transformation Steps:
- **Rename Columns** for clarity:  
  Example: `"State/UT"` â†’ `"State_UT"`,  
  `"Population(2011)[27][28]"` â†’ `"Population_2011"`,  
- **Change Data Types**:
  - `Population_2011`: Text -> Whole Number
  - `Area_Km2`: Text -> Whole Number 
### Load & Apply:
- After transformations, load the data using **Home > Close & Apply**.

## 6. Conclusion & Future Enhancements

This project successfully demonstrated the process of extracting, transforming, and visualizing data in Power BI to derive meaningful insights about the States of India.

### Potential Enhancements:

- Integrate more recent population data (e.g., estimated current population).
- Add data on GDP per capita, literacy rates, or other socio-economic indicators for a richer analysis.
- Incorporate geographical mapping visuals to display states on an actual map.
- Create more interactive elements, such as slicers for year selection (if historical data is added) or zone filtering.
- Publish the dashboard to Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.
